I work in a slightly loud environment that I also need to communicate with either coworkers or customers throughout every shift, while also moving around a lot and these work like a dream! Sound quality is clear and still immersive despite not being in your ear canal. The comfort is incredible and can be adjusted to your ear size. I tend to use lower volume with these earbuds, even when I'm in a quieter environment, so I feel like my ears are protected from hearing damage. They connected seamlessly to my phone and they reconnect seamlessly after taking them off then putting them back on. Also, the connectivity is -strong-! The sound and microphone stays clear even when I'm away from my phone from across the opposite end of my house. The design of these keep your ears comfortable. I can wear them for hours without feeling -any- discomfort and there's no need to worry about them popping off or out of your ear during active sessions. Bought these after much research on open-ear buds, because I also wanted good call quality in addition to being able to hear my surroundings, and these generally came up on top for call quality on multiple articles comparing different brands of open-ear buds. Was slightly skeptical because of the cost/sale, but felt confidence knowing they're made by Anker. I am absolutely delighted with the quality and performance for the cost I paid. Amazing deal for the price.",

They hang around your ear from the front and tuck in, and are pretty easy to forget once you get used to it. Very lightweight. Sound quality is surprisingly good! Bass response is not as prominent as say airpod pros, but I attribute that to the difference in type, open vs closed. Battery life has been great. I do have a pair of airpod pros, but during use, they end up sliding out, no matter which tip I try. The Anker Soundcore V20i with the hook design stay on no matter how sweaty I get during a workout, and I can still hear everything great without needing transparency mode. Battery life has been surprisingly good, have not had to charge the case yet in about a week's worth of casual use, but I suppose that's expected given Anker's battery background! I do trust Anker as a brand, they have made really reliable battery and charging products so I'm glad I gave these a try.",

They aren’t marketed as “sport headphones,” but don’t let that fool you — when paired with a Garmin watch, they deliver surprisingly solid performance. I ran for 45 minutes straight this morning without a single audio dropout. The sound is decent — not audiophile-level, but more than good enough for music, podcasts, and motivation on the go. The fit is soft, light, and stable. I almost forgot I was wearing them. For non-demanding ears, these are a fantastic budget choice for daily use and running. I honestly don’t understand why Soundcore doesn’t promote these more for fitness — they outperform many overhyped \"sports\" earbuds I’ve used in the past.",

          "text": "I've been using wireless earbuds to listen to true crime podcasts at work for quite a few years. I have sensitive ears, so the type of earbud that you just shove into your ear canal doesn't work for me; they hurt my ears. I was finally able to settle on a neckband, with small molded buds that nestle in the outer part of the ear, pointed into the canal. I used soft silicone ear tips that hooked into the upper part of my ear, and they were pretty comfy. However, the neckband was silicone connected to hard plastic, and after a while of putting them on and taking them off, the silicone breaks away from the hard plastic, and while the sound is fine, the earbuds just fall apart. I had three or four of the same neckands, and I finally just got fed up and started looking for something different. Initially, neckband batteries lasted longer than individual earbuds, but now that's not necessarily the case. The problem for me was finding molded earbuds small enough to not hurt my ears. So I found these and decided to give them a try, and I'm very glad I did. They have a silicone piece that hooks over the ear, and the speaker lies up against the outer ear, with four different positions for adjustment. I need a few things with my work earbuds: 1. Battery life. I start my day at 7:30 am, and around 3:30 pm, I get a sound notifying me that the battery is at 20%. I only wear one at a time because I'm at work, and I don't want to be completely shut off from my coworkers should they need to speak to me. If, for some reason, the one bud dies, I can switch to the other one, which is still in the case and charged. 2. Multipoint connection. I have these connected to my tablet, which is how I listen to podcasts, and my cell phone at the same time, so if I get a phone call, it automatically disconnects from the tablet and switches to my ringing phone. 3. Range. I get up from my desk and move around the office, and I've had some earbuds that wouldn't stay connected at as little as 15 feet away. I experimented once with these, and I would say that at approximately 70 feet away from my tablet, around a corner, they started breaking up a bit. That is, by far, the longest range I've ever come across. I also have a restroom that's maybe 30 or 40 feet away with a thick wall separating it from my devices, and they stay connected. 4. Comfort. Once or twice a day, I need to pull the speaker away from my ear for a few seconds because it gets a tiny bit achy, but comparatively, they are comfortable. Bonus: with other earbuds, if I stay out of range for too long, I often have to reconnect when I get back in range. With these, they will automatically reconnect. There's an app that can be used; you can customize the sound and set functions. For instance, you can set the volume to increase or decrease with one tap or two taps, etc. When the battery is low, you can just put them back in the case and they'll charge up again, even without the case being plugged in. I'm very happy that I found these!",

Lakin kulak hassiyetim gereği bunu Anker memnuniyetime güvenerek, iyi fiyat görünce aldım . Hemen belirteyim sesi bana fazlası ile yeterli, lakin genç ya da çok yüksek sesle bass vs. detaylı ayırt edenlerden iseniz deneyim önce derim. Emin olun. Uygulaması detaylı güzel, lakin çok efekt olmasına ragmen ben en iyi en-temiz ses veren \"volume-booster\". Bence buna odaklanmalılar. Digerleri biraz boğuk sesler çünkü. Belki yeni versiyonlarda artar. O zaman cihaz bu fiyat da kalmaz. Telefon görüşmesi de bence çok iyi. Benim hoşuma giden hiçbir ayarlama yapmadan laptop-cep tel anında değişimleri çok iyi yapıyor, yani hangisi aktif ise (2 cihaz). Kulağa sıkı bağlanması, seviye ayarlama etkili söylemiyorum bile. İlk takarken alışmak lazım. Şamda kayısı bile daha pahalıdır:) Tek umudum orta ve uzun kullanımda bu memnuniyetimin değişmemesi..",

          "text": "I’m a fan of Soundcore products. The V20i is an amazing product, especially given the ridiculously low price. The sound is excellent, due to the 16 mm drivers — large for earbuds— which produces surprisingly good bass. Hard to believe that such good sound comes out of such a tiny product. There is an app for Soundcore products, which an equalizer with 22 sound profiles (I use “Piano”), plus the ability to design a custom profile. One of the profiles is called “Volume booster”, useful for noisy environments. I wear my earbuds mostly for listening to podcasts while walking for exercise. In the past, whenever I wanted to listen to music, I would switch to my Soundcore Life Q30 headphones. Now, with these earbuds, it’s not so necessary. The earbuds are stable, not likely to fall out. I can wear glasses OK with the earbuds, but maybe not all day. There is another model, the V30i, which is not an upgrade. It’s just a different set of specs, including a larger battery (12 hrs instead of 8), less bass boost and fewer sound profiles. Sound-core has released the V40i, which has differently shaped drivers, possibly slightly improved sound and an innovative case. I purchased this product, but returned it because it hurt my ears to wear them.",
